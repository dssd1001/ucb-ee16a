    "<p>A voltage follower (also called a unity-gain amplifier, a buffer amplifier, and an isolation amplifier) is a op-amp circuit which has a voltage gain of 1.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This means that the op amp does not provide any amplification to the signal. The reason it is called a voltage follower is because the output voltage directly follows the input voltage, meaning the output voltage is the same as the input voltage. Thus, for example, if `10V` goes into the non-inverting terminal of the op-amp as input, `10V` comes out as output. A voltage follower acts as a so-called \"buffer\", providing no amplification or attenuation to the signal.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Purpose of a Buffer?**\n",
    "<p>Op-amps typically have very high input <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance\">impedance</a> (see link for information on impedance). When a circuit has a very high input impedance, very little current is drawn from the circuit. We know this from Ohm's Law: since I=V/R, if R is large then I is small. Thus, the greater the resistance, the less current is drawn from a power source. So, the power of the circuit isn't affected when the current is feeding a high impedance load. But what happens if our load has relatively low-impedance?</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit below contains a power source that feeds a low-impedance load. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/images/touchscreen_img/touch_pics/Power-source-with-low-impedance-load.png\" height=\"100%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the circuit above, the load demands and draws a huge amount of current due to the load is low impedance. Again, according to Ohm's Law, I=V/R: so if a load has very low resistance, it draws a large amount of current. This large current leads to a huge amount of power being drawn from the power source and, because of this, can potentially cause disturbances to circuit. Now, let's examine a circuit with a Buffer tracking the input signal to the load (below).\n",
    "<img src=\"http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/images/touchscreen_img/touch_pics/Power-source-with-high-input-impedance.png\" height=\"100%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This circuit above draws very little current from the power source above (op-amps have high input impedance). As such, very little power is drawn, which prevents disturbances to the original circuit. In addition, the Buffer with output the same signal fed into the non-inverting terminal. In conclusion, buffers isolate a circuit so that the power of the circuit is disturbed very little.</p>"
